        <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat",[10] is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters.[26][27] He desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King,[28] which would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers, and crew.[29][30] He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.[31]

            Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army,[32] and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp,[33] and their family carries the initial and Will of D. At age 7, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which turned his body into rubber.[34] Shanks also gave Luffy the very straw hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday after he became a great pirate.[35] Growing up on Dawn Island under the care of Curly Dadan,[36] Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace[37] and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo.[38]
            
            Luffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the Grand Line, emerging victorious in a majority of these battles. He invaded and indirectly caused the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaped the impregnable Impel Down, and was a focal figure in the Summit War of Marineford. He has also either defeated or befriended seven of the eleven known past or present Warlords prior to the organization's dissolution. Furthermore, Luffy has invaded the territory of the Four Emperors on multiple occasions, and eventually managed to defeat one. Luffy's accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element" while in the process gaining a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some cases, "insane," earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters, and even the World Government.[39]
            
            Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea," though many prominent figures initially considered this to be exaggerated.[40] However, after defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima, Luffy was officially declared as one of the Four Emperors by the World Government along with Buggy, replacing Kaidou and Big Mom.</p>    
        <p>Luffy has made tremendous strides in his life of piracy, with his bounty heavily reflecting this fact. He gained his first bounty of Beli30,000,000 for defeating the strongest pirate captains of the East Blue, which then increased to Beli100,000,000 after defeating Crocodile in Arabasta. After his crew's invasion into and escape from Enies Lobby, his bounty was increased to Beli300,000,000. His sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Luffy, along with Zoro to be included among the eleven "Super Rookies," pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War.[41] He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation."[42]

            Two years after the war, with his bounty increased to Beli400,000,000, he entered the New World and began challenging the Emperors and their allies directly, with his bounty going up to Beli500,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, and later all the way to Beli1,500,000,000 after the global revelation that he is Sabo's brother and the existence of Straw Hat Grand Fleet becoming public, as well as the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc. After leading the Raid on Onigashima and defeating Kaidou as well he became a member of the Four Emperors, his bounty was increased to Beli3,000,000,000.</p>
    <h2 id="Zoro">Roronoa Zoro</h2>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roronoa_Zoro"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/5/52/Roronoa_Zoro_Anime_Post_Timeskip_Infobox.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/188?cb=20141008195159" width="10%" align="left"></a>
        <p>Roronoa Zoro,[20] also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro,[9] is a main combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[4] and is publicly recognized as the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy.[21][22] Formerly a bounty hunter,[6] he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.[2]

            Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a matrilineal descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma.[3][11] As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio".[23][24] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his fallen childhood friend Kuina.</p>
        <p>In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, Zoro, alongside his captain are included among the ranks of the "Worst Generation", pirates who simultaneously reached the Sabaody Archipelago with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War, as well as Marshall D. Teach.[26][27]

            He gained his first bounty of Beli60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to Beli120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to Beli320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc.[17] Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,111,000,000.</p>
        <p>During and after the two-year timeskip, Zoro gains a new scar running down over his left eye, which is now implied to be critically injured, as it is always closed. His frame gets larger, showing considerably more muscle mass, and his hair has gotten shaggier, while slicked back. Zoro now wears a long, open dark-green coat closed on his waist that's held by a red sash, into which his three swords are tucked. His black bandanna is tied around his left forearm. His coat exposes his bare chest, revealing his green haramaki underneath the coat. He has also grown noticeably taller, as he is similar in height to Robin.

            During the Punk Hazard Arc, he wore a white furry coat for protection against the cold weather on the COOL side of Punk Hazard, which he took from Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit.</p>
        <p>During the Wano Country Arc, Zoro wore a white yukata with black details and a green cloud pattern on its bottom. He wore a dark green jittoku haori with a mon of a black sun over a khaki gear, and zōri with a black strap. Zoro also styled his hair in the chonmage style. After agreeing to allow Shusui to return to Ryuma's grave and remain in Wano, Zoro was given the legendary blade Enma in exchange, which was entrusted to him by Kozuki Hiyori, the daughter of the sword's original owner, the legendary Samurai, Kozuki Oden.[28] During the raid on Onigashima, Zoro donned a black version of his normal coat and a new bright red sash. He also briefly wore a Beasts Pirates uniform created by Kin'emon, before he and Luffy were discovered by the enemy pirates.</p>
    <h2 id="Sanji">Black Leg Sanji</h2>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanji_(One_Piece)"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/b/b6/Sanji_Anime_Post_Timeskip_Infobox.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/167?cb=20170625125657" width="8%" align="right"></a>
        <p>"Black Leg" Sanji,[12] born as Vinsmoke Sanji,[21][22][23] is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[5] He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.

            Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family[24] (thus, making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult.[25] After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.
            
            His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio".[26][27]
            
            He first gained a bounty of Beli77,000,000 for his role in the raid on Enies Lobby. It increased to Beli177,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, but the condition of his bounty was changed to Only Alive due to his biological father's interference. After he escaped from Big Mom's territory, his bounty condition was reverted back to Dead or Alive, and its value increased to Beli330,000,000.[19] Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,032,000,000.[5] Despite renouncing his surname Vinsmoke,[22] the World Government labels it as part of his name on his wanted poster.</p>
        <p>Sanji is a slim, muscular, long-legged man with blond hair which he keeps brushed over one side of his face. Before the timeskip, this was the left side. After the two-year timeskip, he switched his hairstyle so that it covers the right side. It also appears that Sanji's hair is less straight and scruffier after the timeskip.[28]

            Among Sanji's physical traits are his distinctive eyebrows. Both form a spiral but at different ends. His right eyebrow forms a spiral at the outer end, while his left eyebrow forms a spiral at the inner end. His eyebrows curl in the opposite direction from his siblings, whose eyebrows curl in a counterclockwise direction (i.e., to the left side). Sanji's eyebrows instead curl in a clockwise direction (i.e., to right side). During his battle with Queen, when his dormant genetic modifications awakened, Sanji's eyebrows switched to curling in the same direction as his siblings' (i.e., to the left side).[29][30] After being unconscious for a brief period, when he awoke, his eyebrows had returned to their original shape.[31] When fighting S-Shark, his eyebrows changed direction again.[32]
            
            While Sanji's eyes usually seem black, he was depicted with grey-blue eyes in the anime at the beginning of Thriller Bark Arc.[33] This is shown again during the Punk Hazard Arc, when Trafalgar Law switched Sanji into Nami's body, and her usual brown eyes became grey blue in color.[34]
            
            Sanji almost always wears a black, double-breasted suit with golden buttons and a tie together with a long-sleeved buttoned shirt of varying colors, usually orange, blue, turquoise, or black, with or without pinstripes. His outfit changes on a more frequent basis than most of the crew.
            
            As a child, Sanji wore a yellow shirt with the number "3" on it, white pants, brown boots, and a light-yellow bandana around his neck. His hair was styled in the opposite manner as it is in the present.</p>
        
    <h2 id="Robin">Nico Robin Demon Child</h2>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Robin"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/5/52/Nico_Robin_Manga_Pre_Timeskip_Infobox.png/revision/latest?cb=20170318220645" width="8.5%" align="left"></a>
        <p>Nico Robin,[17] also known by her epithet "Devil Child"[7] and the "Light of the Revolution",[8] is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[3] She is the seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during the Water 7 Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc.

            Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is currently one of only two people in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government.
            
            She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All Sunday",[1] serving and partnering herself directly with the organization's president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century.
            
            She gained a bounty of Beli79,000,000 at the age of 8 due to her ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara. It later increased to Beli80,000,000 after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby to rescue her and escape. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to Beli130,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased to Beli930,000,000.</p>
        <p>From the Return to Sabaody Arc to near the end of the Fish-Man Island Arc, Robin's black hair (also lightened in color) has grown longer, which reaches to her lower back, and it is pulled back, so it reveals more of her forehead and ears. After the timeskip, her outfit now is a long salmon sarong skirt that has a design of a green seaweed with red and yellow flowers on the side with ruffles that bares her hips with a partially-zipped short-sleeved navy blue (sometimes purple in manga and some other media) leather vest with a V-neck line and an image of her Devil Fruit or of an actual Chrysanthemum morifolium is printed on the left breast near the shoulder that exposes her stomach, darker pink (sometimes red in other media) high heeled pumps, and a lavender pink backpack. She wears white sunglasses with orange lenses (black in the manga) which she hangs on her forehead and is seen wearing them during the battle with the New Fish-Man Pirates in the Gyoncorde Plaza.

        Like Nami, Robin's breasts have also grown much larger and rounder, but her appearance has not changed much, save for the fact that her hourglass figure and body curves have become more pronounced. Robin's skin tone seemed to lighten with color to the point of the manga's skin color (possibly due to the time spent training indoors). Unlike the other members, Robin did not grow taller as she remains at 188 cm.
        
        After the battle for Fish-Man Island, Robin wore a teal, long-sleeved V-neck dress. While exploring the Burning Lands of Punk Hazard during the Punk Hazard Arc with some of her crewmates, Robin removes her dress due to the heat to reveal a floral camisole and black shorts; she later ties the dress around her waist. She also has on very high heels with this outfit and still wears her new trademark sunglasses over her forehead. She later wears a long, spotted winter coat over this while on the Ice Lands of the island, which she took from a female member of Brownbeard's Centaur Patrol Unit.
        
        During the events in Dressrosa, she wears a very short, black dress. It is low cut, and hence, a large portion of her breasts are visible, as well as her legs and lower thighs. Her costume also includes her sunglasses, black high-heel boots, and a white bell-brimmed hat. She also chooses to wear her hair in a high ponytail. The hat was an extra precaution she used to hide her face along with her sunglasses to avoid being spotted by her enemies on the island, primarily the CP0 agents. She also temporarily disguised herself as one of the grunts in the Donquixote Pirates, borrowing a uniform similar to that of a burglar with a dark long-sleeved turtleneck, dark camouflage pants, boots, gloves, and a unique horned hat (as some of the grunts wore unique headgear).
        
        After the events of Dressrosa Arc, she wears a light-colored tank top with the word "Corrida" written on it along with dark-colored shorts (pink tank top and purple shorts in the anime).
        
        During the Zou Arc, she wears a light purple turtleneck, dark, fuchsia-colored shorts, and cream heels.
        
        During the Wano Country Arc, she tied her hair up, wore lipstick, and dressed in a black traditional Geisha outfit. Her second outfit was a purple kimono in white and purple squares patterns.[18] Her third outfit consists of a mostly white kunoichi attire with a purple daffodil pattern, and a dark purple tsuke obi with a large blue bow in the back, as well as a light purple obiage, and a red obijime. She also has a dark flower pattern-covered cloak over her shoulders, and her hair is tied back with a red ribbon.[19] When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities to disguise them, she wore a Beasts Pirates attire.[20]
        
        During the Egghead Arc, Robin wears a leather jacket that reveals her ample bosom, which is connected by a belt at the bottom of it that wraps around stomach and exposes her midriff, and connects to her panties with 2 lines, along with gloves, an earpiece and a pair of DOM Shoes.</p>   
    <h2 id="Nami">Nami</h2>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nami_(One_Piece)"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/6/68/Nami_Anime_Post_Timeskip_Infobox.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/298?cb=20190720162446" width="13%" align="right"></a>
        <p>"Cat Burglar" Nami[11] is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[4] She is the third member of the crew and the second to join, doing so during the Orange Town Arc.[19] She is the adoptive sister of Nojiko after the two were orphaned and taken in by Bell-mère.

            She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the Straw Hats so that she could rob them in order to buy back her village from Arlong. However, she legitimately joined the Straw Hats after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong. Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.[20]
            
            She first gained a bounty of Beli16,000,000 following the raid on Enies Lobby. It later increased to Beli66,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased to Beli366,000,000.</p>
        <p>Nami is a slim young woman of average height with orange hair and brown eyes. Many characters seem to consider her to be an attractive woman.[citation needed] She has a black tattoo (blue in the anime)[21] on her left shoulder, which represents mikan, and pinwheels (a homage to Bell-mère, Nojiko, and Genzo, respectively), where she used to have a tattoo for being a member of Arlong's crew.[2]

            Her overall physique matures slowly throughout the series and then suddenly during the timeskip (though this is most likely a simple change in style of artwork). Her fashion frequently changes as does her hair style. Many of her shirts feature four-letter words, such as "Gold" or "EVIL", similar to a shirt that Bell-mère once wore that had "MACE" on it. On her left wrist, she wears the Log Pose, which she needs in order to be the navigator of the ship, and a gold bracelet, given to her by her sister, Nojiko.[22] After the Arlong Park Arc, Nami frequently changes into a variety of clothes in the series for each arc, and usually pairs her tops with skirts that have two rings on the sides. Her trademark shoes are orange high-heeled gladiator sandals. Nami wears some form of high heels in every arc, and while they do make her taller, they do not seem to affect the way she walks or her speed. Though she tends to style her hair neatly, occasionally, a hair on top of her head may form into a messy cowlick.
            
            She wears a strap around her thigh with three slots in it which she keeps each pole of her bo staff and later the Clima-Tact in.</p>
    <h2 id="Usopp">Usopp</h2>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usopp"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/onepiece/images/3/35/Usopp_Anime_Post_Timeskip_Infobox.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/269?cb=20221127233827" width="13%" align="left"></a>
        <p>"God" Usopp[9] is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[2] He is the fourth member of the crew and the third to join, doing so at the end of the Syrup Village Arc. Although he left the crew during the Water 7 Arc, he rejoined at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.[16]

            Usopp is the son of Yasopp and Banchina. He was born and raised in Syrup Village, serving as "captain" of the Usopp Pirates and being Kaya's close friend. After working with the Straw Hats to defeat Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he was invited to join the crew. Despite his usual cowardice, Usopp dreams of becoming a brave warrior of the sea just like his father and lives every day in pursuit of living up to this dream.
            
            He first gained a bounty of Beli30,000,000 under his Sogeking Persona after the incident at Enies Lobby. After the Dressrosa Arc, Usopp gained a bounty of Beli200,000,000 under his own name. Following the events from the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was raised to Beli500,000,000.</p>
        <p>Usopp is a slim tan-skinned teenager with medium-length black curly hair, prominent lips and a long nose, which is apparently an allusion to Pinocchio (a wooden boy from a story of the same name who possessed a nose that would stretch after he lied). Usopp inherited his famous nose from his mother, while the rest of his face closely resembles his father's. During the Straw Hat separation, after landing in the Boin Archipelago, Usopp grew obese from overeating.

            Like the rest of the males of the crew, he wore one outfit for the majority of the series before wearing different clothing by the end of the Paradise. Usopp usually wore an olive green plaid bandanna, a blue and white striped armband on his left arm, along with special sniper goggles (he also has a pair of clear rectangular goggles that he sometimes wears in situations where he does not have his sniper goggles, like when he first met the Straw Hat Pirates or when his sniper goggles were stolen by Mr. 2), brown overalls with a white sash and no shirt underneath. He also carries with him a yellow satchel, which he stores all his tools and gadgets in.
            
            During the Drum Island Arc, he wore a brown jumper with white fur collar and cuffs, faded yellow gloves and grey pants with a black "c" pattern.
            
            While onboard the Puffing Tom he put on a gold colored sun-like mask he found in a compartment over his goggles and wore a red cape, calling this superhero persona "Sogeking". Usopp wore this costume for the rest of the Enies Lobby Arc.
            
            During the Thriller Bark Arc Usopp wore a purple cape and a wide brim purple hat with a necklace of garlic to ward off evil creatures.
            
            During Sabaody Archipelago Arc Usopp wore an unbuttoned turquoise shirt instead of his overalls and some green shorts with a yellow flower pattern on one leg.</p>
        <p>After the two year timeskip, Usopp has become much more muscular than before and has grown his hair out. He has become "manlier" and is slightly taller than before.

            Usopp now has a new pair of goggles around his neck (his sniper goggles weren't shown) and has some headphones or ear protectors on. He also now has a little goatee along with a new white sun cap he wears on his head. He also has a new pair of rolled-up yellow pants with red suspenders and a pair of boots.
            During the raid on Onigashima, Usopp wears his usual yellow pants, blue and white striped wristband, satchel, and headphones, however instead of suspenders, Usopp decides to wear a dark multi-colored armor plate with brown gloves and red protective head gear. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities again to disguise them, he wore a Beasts Pirates disguise, adding his googles as a part of the disguise.
            
            During the Egghead Arc, Usopp wears a light full-body jumpsuit and a dark jacket with matching gloves and bandanna, and an earpiece with a antenna on it. He also wears a pair of dark sunglasses, a dark leg strap and a pair of DOM Shoes.</p>
        <p> we call him<h4>Go D Usopp</h4></p>
